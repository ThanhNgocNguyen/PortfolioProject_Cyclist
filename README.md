# PortfolioProject_Cyclist

This is my analysis of the Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? from Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone projects.
Cyclist is a successful bike sharing platform with flexible pricing plans. The company generates more revenues from membership plans, therefore it wants to develop a successful marketing campaign that can convert casual riders into members.
As a junior data analyst at the Cyclistic marketing analytics team, I am responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. 
I use R to clean and analyse data and Tableau for visualization.
You can find my R code in the Rmd file above.
